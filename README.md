Causal learning and prediction using Bayesian networks and Machine learning for coronavirus  pandemic


Abstractâ€”Ever since the coronavirus was declared a
pandemic in March 2020 many academic and scientific
research studies were carried out to understand the
characteristics of the virus and to help governments to bring
necessary actions including lockdowns and vaccinations. In this
research, we present a Bayesian network along with a machine
learning approach for novel coronavirus scenario. The
manually constructed BN revolves around the node need for
oxygen treatment which is essential for the treatment of
coronavirus disease. Different causal structure learning
unsupervised algorithms are used to learn causal relationships
of covid symptoms data. To predict missing values, supervised
machine learning techniques such as logistic regression,
Support vector machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors were
used, and logistic regression obtained a better accuracy of
90.5%. This approach combines unsupervised learning
algorithms for causal structure learning and supervised
learning algorithms for predictions. Structure learning
algorithms provide ways to provide human knowledge as
constraints onto the model. Supervised machine learning is
useful when there are nodes where there are missing values or
for those days where a machine failure was noted or some
unavoidable circumstances, and data could not be evaluated
and entered as observations. Thus, this powerful combination
is explored in this study and is important to understand how
BN fills a few important gaps in the machine learning world.
